# Distinct compiler repair review

One tool-disabled Sonnet call reviewed exact33801deb384e912b059409b0ca408f41a54b3664 production repair against complete504b originals and all16 actual rendered compiler errors. It completed in42.162638583seconds, exit0, peak process-group RSS327401472bytes, no resource refusal. Returned model claude-sonnet-5-5; provider list cost USD0.129264, actual billing unknown. Full raw usage/model receipt is preserved. No old827 review was retried.

Claude found no concrete blocker in the three-file diff. It concluded the borrowed Result/Option adapters preserve work, first-error propagation, values and borrowed lifetimes without cloning. It identified source uncertainties rather than asserting compilation.

Local source discharge: cleanup_plan/replay.rs59 explicitly reexports physical_clone::ClonePayload, and cleanup_plan.rs37 reexports that same item as ReplayClonePayload. Therefore the import uses the identical existing ResolvedType census. prelude_bundle/borrowed.rs7-12 defines the pub(crate) declarations_slice/types_slice methods; their504b errors were unloaded-child cascades. All11 explicitly named child files exist in exact338 source, and none declares another out-of-line mod. Source hashes for these checks are preserved separately. No additional confirmed defect was found.

The review does not validate the rest of827/828, physical funding or live compilation. Loading formerly missing child modules can expose additional errors, and actual root compile/runtime gates remain authoritative. No Cargo, tests or root edits were performed by this review lane.
