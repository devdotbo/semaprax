# Ownership clone census accounting correction

Source-only base9285; no Cargo/build/tests/observer/caps edits. No heap18 attribution or app-fit claim.

The new ownership payer entered the real ResolvedType ClonePayload census without reserving its514 Option<(&ResolvedType,usize)> inline cursor. Replay allocation.rs200 explicitly requires paying that exact cursor before preflight initialization. This is inline accounting; census allocates no heap and shared IDs clone with no new backing.

Payer now owns one cursor-paid bool, funded before construction. Every clone authenticates reserve0. The first census prepays the complete514-frame array before initialization; subsequent clones reuse the same lexical payer reservation, while still paying complete actual clone payload and retaining sticky refusal. Storage's original containing-carrier reservation stays unchanged. No refund/new limit.

Independent Claude caught eager factory funding breaking unchanged primitive zero-limit controls. Corrected by additive type_flags_paid_lazy: authenticate, EXACT literal original primitive/cache gates, and invoke paid factory only on existing constructor branch. Original paid.rs body remains complete independently compiled. Ownership hook passes explicit same-active-payer authenticate/new function items. State is private to one lexical fallback invocation, never cached across budgets/validators.

Full original paid.rs archived/fixedSHA; removing only exact named lazy span restores original whole source byteexact and lazy fast gate text equals original. Four full ownership-source inverses still pass original fixed hashes; only exact current nominal hook string updated. Original owningtests prefix byteexact. No flagswalker/key/substitute/admission or ClonePayload changes.
