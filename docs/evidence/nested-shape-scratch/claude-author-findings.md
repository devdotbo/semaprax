Nothing was compiled or run, as requested, so the diff below is unverified. Hunks are anchored by context rather than line numbers, because I don't have the file offsets.

## Design

- `Scratch` lives in an inline child `mod scratch` and holds exactly two `Vec`s, `frames` and `shapes`. `CaseMeta` and `Frame` move into that module with their definitions unchanged.
- `derive` keeps its exact signature and behaviour. It builds `Scratch::default()` and calls `derive_reusing`, which takes one extra `&mut Scratch`.
- A `Lease` guard clears both vectors in `Drop`, so success, `?` failure and panic unwind all leave empty payloads. `clear()` keeps the capacity, and the caller's `Scratch` owns the backing until it is dropped. There is no `mem::take`, shrink, refund, cap, cache or summary.
- `reserve_clone`, `reserve_vec`, `push` and `array` are called in the same places and the same order as before.
- `Budget`, `next_flag` and the per-root `Budget::default()` stay per call. Body validation is untouched.

## Diff: wrapper

`expected_shape_for_type_paid` is unchanged. Add:

```diff
+pub(super) fn expected_shape_for_type_paid_reusing(
+    program: &dyn crate::cleanup::ReplayContext,
+    function: &ResolvedFunction,
+    ty: &ResolvedType,
+    next_flag: &mut u32,
+    physical: &mut ReplayBudget,
+    scratch: &mut paid::Scratch,
+) -> Result<FieldLivenessShape, Diagnostic> {
+    paid::derive_reusing(
+        program,
+        function,
+        ty,
+        next_flag,
+        0,
+        &mut Budget::default(),
+        physical,
+        scratch,
+    )
+}
```

A caller creates one `paid::Scratch::default()` outside the inventory slot loop and passes `&mut` to it for each slot.

## Concrete obstacles

1. **`reserve_bytes0` is not in the supplied text.** I could not authenticate it, and the diff never calls it. If it matters for the zero-size case, I need its definition.
2. **`ReplayBudget::reserve_vec`, `push` and `array` are unseen.**
   - If `reserve_vec` charges relative to existing capacity, a reused `Scratch` is only charged for growth. In that case, pair each `Scratch` with a single `ReplayBudget`. Otherwise later budgets get capacity they never paid for.
   - If it charges the full request regardless of capacity, reuse is merely conservative.
   - Dropping `&mut` assumes `reserve_vec` takes `&mut Vec<T>` explicitly, so `frames` is implicitly reborrowed. If it is generic over the container, `frames` would be moved and need `&mut *frames`.
3. **The inventory slot loop is not shown.** I could add the entry points but not wire the reuse into the loop.
4. **Visibility is the one change to the moved types.** `CaseMeta` and `Frame` are now `pub(super)`, and `CaseMeta`'s fields are `pub(super)`, because `derive_reusing` constructs and reads them from the parent module. Names, fields and variants are otherwise identical.
5. **`derive_reusing` has 8 parameters,** which trips `clippy::too_many_arguments`. I added a targeted `#[allow]`. `derive` itself stays at 7.
6. **Clearing happens in `Lease::drop`, not at function end.** It still runs after the result value is built, so the returned shape is already moved out. A panic also clears via unwind, and the capacity is retained either way.
7. **Re-export visibility.** `Scratch` is `pub(in super::super)` so `pub(super) use` can hand it to the wrapper's module. This assumes the wrapper's module is the direct parent of `paid`, which the `paid::derive` call implies.
